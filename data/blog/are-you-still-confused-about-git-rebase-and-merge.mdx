![Git Rebase vs Merge](/static/images/blogs/merge-vs-rebase.gif)

Git is an essential tool for developers, and two of the most confusing yet powerful commands in Git are `rebase` and `merge`. Both are used to integrate changes from one branch into another, but the way they handle history is fundamentally different. If you’ve ever scratched your head trying to decide whether to rebase or merge, this blog post will clear up the confusion and help you make the right decision in your workflow.

## 🔎 What’s the Difference Between Git Rebase and Git Merge?
At a high level:

- **Git Merge**:  Creates a new commit (e.g., G’) on the target branch that connects the histories of both the main and feature branches.
- **Git Rebase**: Moves the feature branch commits to the top of the target branch, creating new commits (e.g., E’, F’, and G’).

Let’s break this down with some examples to help you visualize the difference.

## 📚 Understanding Git Merge
When you use `git merge`, Git creates a new merge commit that ties together the histories of both branches.

**✅ Benefits of Git Merge:**
- Retains the complete history of both branches.
- Shows a clear record of when branches were combined.
- Works well for collaborative projects where preserving the history is important.

**❌ Downsides of Git Merge:**
- Can create a messy history with many merge commits.
- The commit graph can become hard to read, especially in large projects.

**Example of Git Merge:**
```bash
# On the main branch
git merge feature-branch
```
**Result in the commit graph:**
```sql
*   Merge commit
|\
| * Commit from feature branch
* | Previous commit on main
```

## 🔄 Understanding Git Rebase
When you use git rebase, Git moves the commits from one branch onto the tip of another branch. Instead of merging the two histories, it rewrites the commit history.

**✅ Benefits of Git Rebase:**
- Cleaner history: The project’s commit history looks like a straight line.
- Easier to read and understand when reviewing logs.
- Ideal for maintaining a linear project history.

**❌ Downsides of Git Rebase:**
- Rewrites history, which can be dangerous if shared branches are involved.
- Can cause issues if other collaborators have already pulled the original commits.

**Example of Git Rebase:**
```bash
# On the feature branch
git rebase main
```

**Result in the commit graph:**
```bash
* Rebased commit from feature branch
* Previous commit on main
```


## 🤔 When to Use Git Merge vs. Git Rebase?

Here’s a simple guideline to help you decide:

| Scenario	|   Use Merge   |   Use Rebase  |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Collaborative project	    |   ✅	|   ❌  |
| Keeping history intact    |   ✅	|   ❌  |
| Clean, linear history |   ❌	|   ✅  |
| Working on your own branch    |   ✅	|   ✅  |
| Avoiding messy merge commits  |   ❌	|   ✅  |

## 💡 A Common Workflow Using Both Merge and Rebase
The best practice is to use both commands depending on the situation.

1. Rebase your feature branch before merging to keep your history clean.
2. Merge your feature branch into the main branch to preserve collaboration history.

```bash
# 1. Switch to your feature branch
git checkout feature-branch

# 2. Rebase your feature branch onto the latest main branch
git rebase main

# 3. Switch to the main branch
git checkout main

# 4. Merge your feature branch
git merge feature-branch
```

## 🛑 Warning: Avoid Rebasing Shared Branches!
One of the biggest mistakes developers make is rebasing a branch that others are working on. This can cause serious issues because rebasing **rewrites history**. As a rule of thumb:

- ✅ **Safe to rebase**: Local, unshared branches.
- ❌ **Avoid rebasing**: Branches that have been pushed to a shared repository.

## 🎯 Quick Tips to Avoid Confusion
- Use merge for shared branches to preserve history.
- Use rebase for your own branches to keep the commit history clean.
- Always pull with rebase to avoid unnecessary merge commits:

```bash
git pull --rebase
```
> [!CAUTION]
> Remember the golden rule: **Never rebase a branch that has already been pushed and shared.**

## 🚀 Final Thoughts
Both `git merge` and `git rebase` have their own use cases. Merging is great for preserving history in collaborative projects, while rebasing keeps your history clean and linear. The key to mastering Git is knowing when to use each command.

Next time you’re wondering whether to merge or rebase, ask yourself:

- Do I need a clean, linear history? **→ Rebase**
- Do I want to preserve the history of both branches? **→ Merge**

Now that you understand the difference, you can confidently choose the right approach in your Git workflow!
