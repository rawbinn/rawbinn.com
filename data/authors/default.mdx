## Sides Projects

I engage in multiple side projects, but I deliberately limit myself to completing one per year to ensure its successful realization.

### CoinSense - Money Tracking App

CoinSense serves as a comprehensive financial management application that seamlessly monitors your day-to-day income, expenses, loans, and group expenditures. Additionally, it features a reminder system to prompt you about crucial transactions. Collaborative expense tracking is made simple, allowing you to share expense lists with colleagues who can contribute their expenses to the shared list. Developed using NextJs and Laravel, CoinSense provides a robust and efficient platform for managing your financial activities. If you want to contribute inbox me at [contact@rawbinn.com]

### Multivendor Ecommerce

The multivendor ecommerce project, built on Laravel 9.0 and powered by a MySQL database, enables multiple vendors to create their online stores. With advanced features like secure payment integration and efficient order processing, this platform offers a user-friendly shopping experience. Leveraging Laravel 9.0 and MySQL, it ensures scalability and robustness for successful multivendor ecommerce operations.
